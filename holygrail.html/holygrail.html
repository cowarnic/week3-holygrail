    <header><P>The header will default to the top and be first since it listed first.  There is also no position that is being applied to it
        so it would not be affected by any of the positioning.
    </P></header>

    <nav><p>The nav bar is located below the header so it will be next.  Since it using the fixed position it will be in the same spot even if the page is scrolled and it
        can be positioned by top, right, bottom, and left.  It set to be under the header by default of the order.

        <div class="articles">

            <article><p>This article uses relative positioning so it relative to the normal position.  If you set top,right, bott, or left then it will be adjusted to
                that from the normal position.  The information was set via the code such as left: 30px, top:40px, width: 65%, and height: 70%.  It is going to be relativeto the
                other article which has different measurements.

    <aside><p>The side is kinda of like a sidebar for the content.  Just because you use the aside tag it does not automatically place it where you want
        on the side.  The information provided to the tag is what makes the location of the aside be where it is.  Such as the top, height, width, and etc.

    <footer><p>The footer is automatically placed towards the bottom of the page.  The width, height, color, position, etc. can be changed
        Its also using the fixed position which will keep it at the same location when the page is scrolled.
